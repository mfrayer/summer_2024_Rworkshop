# Resources for Intro to R and ggplot Workshop

Thanks for participating in the workshop! Here are the resources that we used! I will leave them here so that you can have access to them in the future. 

## Contents: 

This folder contains two small data sets that we will use in the workshop: 

- `flowering_data.txt`
- `germination_data.csv`

This folder also contains:

- `workshop_script.R` : This is the Rscript that I was typing along with you. It does NOT contain everything that we went over. 
- `r_workshop_guide.html` : This is an html document that you can open in your browser window. It goes over everything that we worked through, including some additional things that we didn't get to. 
- `r_workshop_guide.Rmd` : This is the Rmarkdown document that produces the html file above. If you find yourself using R a lot in the future, you may want to learn how to make similar documents, so I am including it here for you. However, you can ignore it and just look at the html document for now. 
- `meme.jpg` : This is a meme that you will find in the guide. I'm including it here in case you want to try rendering the html file yourself.
